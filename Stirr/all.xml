    <title>Skeleton Sea</title>
    <desc>João and Xandi, two surfers in their early 50′s, have been working together for 25 years. They clean beaches and with the trash they pick they create the most stunning artwork. However, living as an artist and idealist in Portugal is not economically profitable and, therefore, not easy.Their family life is affected by the choices they make and their wish to raise awareness about the ever-growing pollution in our oceans. Skeleton Sea takes us on their personal journey to help people understand the importance of our oceans to help us take the step to change our habits to keep them clean. As all live comes from the sea, Skeleton Sea reminds us that this powerful force has the ability of taking it away from us as well.</desc>

With their background in engineering, the unrivalled story is underlined by surfing, adventure and great personalities as the two friends battle their way to achieve a much higher goal: reducing the plastic that ends up in the oceans they surf.</desc>

    <desc>Skippers are getting ready for the 2022 edition of the Vendée Arctique: the solo race that surrounds Iceland before returning back to Les Sables d'Olonne. Jérémie Beyou became the winner of the 2020 edition of this arduous competition, but seeing the trajectory of Charlie Dalin and Thomas Ruyant, competition is closest than ever. Unpredictability in weather forecasts will force organizers to cut the race short, meaning skippers are running out of time to reduce distances. </desc>

    <desc>Another expedition? You must be crazy.This is what Beppe's friend told him when he decided to leave for North America. Even after paddling in the biggest rivers in the world, his desire for adventure was still not satisfied, and he went out looking for more. Dreaming of freedom, sleeping bags and nature, he ventured into the unknown to discover the Yukon and Teslin Rivers.For those unaware, the Yukon river is the major watercourse of the northwest of North America. It flows through the Canadian Yukon Territory and makes it's way to Alaska. The Teslin River is a bit shorter, but not for this reason less fun to dive into. They both offer an impressive scenery amidst cold temperatures, dangerous whitewaters and the wild nature of North America.The Kayak Man takes us on a journey of self discovery through the most beautiful landscapes of Canada and the United States while following the path of a brave kayaker that leaves his life behind in an attempt to explore new horizons by himself. An impressive trip that will not leave him the same way he was before.</desc>

    <title>Transat Jacques Vabre 2021: Review</title>
    <desc>Welcome to the 15th edition of the Transat Jacques Vabre! Injecting a fresh change, sailors will be bound for Martinique as they explore for the first time the West Indies. The four participating classes have taken different routes: while the Class 40 sailed starboard in Cape Verde, the Imocas and Ocean Fifty's starboarded in Fernando de Noronha and the Ultimes in Trinidade and Martim Vaz. This edition has proven to be tougher than usual, and with several accidents taking place during the competition not all parting boats have made it to the Caribbean island. Watch the review of the Transat Jacques Vabre 2021 on Nautical Channel. </desc>

    <title>PaddleSUP Mission Amazon</title>
    <desc>Charlie Head will attempt the first ever stand-up paddle boarding of the main water source of the Amazon, the Rio Marañón in Peru. It’s never been attempted before and will be the most arduous and longest SUP journey ever made.Two months of using just his physical and mental strength, Charlie will overcome extreme terrain, trek around impassable river rock falls, survive freezing waters, high altitude, swarms of insects and suspicious local tribes.However, all the hardships will be worth it if he can help shine some light on one of the planet’s most endangered environments and educates us on conservation as over 20 new dams are planned to be constructed on the river's free-flowing stretches. This could have, according to scientists, drastic consequences on the Amazon basin forever.If Charlie does not embark on this adventure now, he may never be able to do so.

    <title>Vendée Globe Review</title>
    <desc>To date, the VENDÉE GLOBE is the only solo sailing race around the world that is non-stop and without assistance. The event followed in the wake of the Golden Globe that initiated the first circumnavigation of this type via the three capes (Good Hope, Leeuwin and Horn) in 1968.44,996 kilometres, or 24,296 miles. That is the circumference of the Earth. The Vendée Globe accomplishes in 74 days this planetary voyage as participants sail down the Atlantic, across the Indian and face the challenges of the Pacific Ocean. The public refer to this arduous competition as the Everest of the seas, and this 9th edition will see 33 contenders depart from Les Sables-d’ Olonne to take part in a life changing competition.In this year's edition, sailors had to overcome storms, take advantage of high winds and competition has never been this close at the end as three skippers that are just 60 miles apart rush to cross the finish line first.Who ended up getting proclaimed the champion of one of the hardest sailing races in the world? Find it out on Nautical Channel.</desc>

    <title>Breaking Barriers</title>
    <desc>In a world where faith and mental health often intersect, "Breaking Barriers: Seeking Help for Mental Health" aims to shatter the stigma surrounding accessing resources for your mental health. This powerful documentary delves into the misconception that reaching out for professional help is a sign of weakness, emphasizing that true healing often requires a blend of faith, prayer, and professional support.
Through heartfelt interviews with mental health professionals, spiritual leaders, and individuals who have faced mental health challenges, the documentary paints a vivid picture of hope and resilience. Viewers will hear personal stories of struggle and triumph, learn from those who have lost loved ones to suicide, and discover actionable solutions to combat the ongoing mental health crisis in our communities.</desc>

    <desc>In a world where faith and mental health often intersect, "Breaking Barriers: Seeking Help for Mental Health" aims to shatter the stigma surrounding accessing resources for your mental health.

Through heartfelt interviews with mental health professionals, spiritual leaders, and individuals who have faced mental health challenges, the documentary paints a vivid picture of hope and resilience. Viewers will hear personal stories of struggle and triumph, learn from those who have lost loved ones to suicide, and discover actionable solutions to combat the ongoing mental health crisis in our communities.</desc>

    <title>Breaking Barriers</title>
    <desc>In a world where faith and mental health often intersect, "Breaking Barriers: Seeking Help for Mental Health" aims to shatter the stigma surrounding accessing resources for your mental health. This powerful documentary delves into the misconception that reaching out for professional help is a sign of weakness, emphasizing that true healing often requires a blend of faith, prayer, and professional support.
Through heartfelt interviews with mental health professionals, spiritual leaders, and individuals who have faced mental health challenges, the documentary paints a vivid picture of hope and resilience. Viewers will hear personal stories of struggle and triumph, learn from those who have lost loved ones to suicide, and discover actionable solutions to combat the ongoing mental health crisis in our communities.</desc>

    <title>Temples Dot The Land</title>
    <desc>Utah will soon have 28 operating temples. Some are still under construction, restoration or in the Open House period. 
A few have recently been dedicated. In this program, we will focus on the 14 newest temples in Utah by telling the stories of the people connected to them. 
We will also provide a historic look at the other 14 currently operating temples. We will bring you the words of leaders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints about this unprecedented time in temple building and what it says about the faith and worthiness of Church members who live in Utah.</desc>
